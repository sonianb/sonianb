# Hi there, I'm Sonia
I'm here because I ❤️ the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology. 

My goal is to become a well-rounded software developer through self-learning and my apprenticeship at [Agile Collective](https://agile.coop/), work on purpose-driven projects, and be part of the change I want to see in the tech industry.

🪄 **My tech stack includes** JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML and CSS.  
🌱 **I'm currently learning and practising** Vue.js, Nuxt, Drupal, and PHP.
