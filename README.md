# Hi there, I'm Sonia üçã
I'm here because I ‚ù§Ô∏è the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology.

My coding journey stared in April 2021. Now I know that pursuing a career in tech was one of the best decisions I could ever take.
And the reason for that is simple: it combines everything I love doing.
- Building things from scratch. 
- Racking my brain to solve problems.
- Working in a team towards the same goal.  

‚ú® Life gave me the lemons and I'm here to make lemonades taste better.‚ú®

## üå± I'm currently learning and practising 
- Front-End Technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS - which I particularly love)
- Git GUI Tools
- Using APIs

## üî≠ My goals for this year
- Become a technically competent developer through self-learning and the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Coding Bootcamp I'm currently taking part in.
- Work for a product I truly believe in and care about.
- Contribute to open-source projects and share my knowledge with people interested in technology.
- Be part of the change I want to see in the tech industry.
- Oh, and maybe exercise more often!   

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Things that make me happy 
- Healthy productivity and sunny days. 
- Watching independent, art-house films.
- Seeing people being compassionate, supportive, and kind.
