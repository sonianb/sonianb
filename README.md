# Hi there, I'm Sonia
I'm here because I ❤️ the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology.

My coding journey started in April 2021. Pursuing a career in tech was one of the best decisions I ever made because it combines everything I love doing.
- Building things from scratch. 
- Racking my brain to solve problems.
- Working in a team towards the same goal.  

## 🌱 I'm currently learning and practising 
- Vue.js
- Drupal & PHP 

## 🎯 Goals 
- Become a well-rounded software developer through self-learning and my apprenticeship at [Agile Collective](https://agile.coop/).
- Work on purpose-driven projects. 
- Be part of the change I want to see in the tech industry.
