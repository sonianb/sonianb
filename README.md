# Hi there, I'm Sonia 🍋
I'm here because I ❤️ the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology.

My coding journey started in April 2021. Now I know that pursuing a career in tech was one of the best decisions I could ever take.
And the reason for that is simple: it combines everything I love doing.
- Building things from scratch. 
- Racking my brain to solve problems.
- Working in a team towards the same goal.  

## 🌱 I'm currently learning and practising 
- Front-End Technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS - which I particularly love)
- Git Tools
- Unit Testing and TDD

## 🔭 My goals for this year
- Become a technically competent developer through self-learning and the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Coding Bootcamp I'm currently taking part in.
- Work for a product I truly believe in and care about.
- Contribute to open-source projects and share my knowledge with people interested in tech.
- Be part of the change I want to see in the tech industry.

## ☀️ Things that make me happy 
- Healthy productivity and sunny days. 
- Watching films that make me think.
- Seeing people being compassionate, supportive, and kind.
