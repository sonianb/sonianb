# Hi there, I'm Sonia 🍋
I'm here because I ❤️ the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology.

My coding journey started in April 2021. Pursuing a career in tech was one of the best decisions I ever made because it combines everything I love doing.
- Building things from scratch. 
- Racking my brain to solve problems.
- Working in a team towards the same goal.  

## 🌱 I'm currently learning and practising 
- Front-End Technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS - which I particularly love)
- Git Tools

## 🎯 Current goals
- Become a skilled developer through self-learning and the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Coding Bootcamp I'm currently taking part in.
- Work on purpose-driven projects. 
- Be part of the change I want to see in the tech industry.

## ☀️ Things that make me happy 
- Healthy productivity and sunny days. 
- Seeing people being compassionate, supportive, and kind.
