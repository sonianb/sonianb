## Hi there üëã
I'm Sonia and I'm here because I ‚ù§Ô∏è the idea of being able to create purposeful and accessible technology. 

I'm a front-end developer at [Agile Collective](https://agile.coop/), where I work on building websites for purpose-driven, ethical organisations. 

My goal is not to just find solutions that work but are also accessible, performant and offer a good, intuitive user experience. 

Tech Stack: Drupal, React, Vue.js, Next.js, CSS, JavaScript, GraphQL, MySQL
